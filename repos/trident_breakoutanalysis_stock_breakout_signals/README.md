## 🔍 What Is a Breakout?

A **breakout** happens when a stock makes a sudden, decisive move — typically a sharp price increase on high trading volume. Breakouts matter because they often signal that something significant is happening: an earnings beat, a product launch, a buyout rumor, or a shift in market sentiment.

The key signals of a real breakout (vs. random noise):
- 📈 **Big price move** — the stock is up significantly today (e.g. 6%+)
- 🔊 **Unusually high volume** — far more shares are trading than normal (2-3x average)
- 💰 **Real company** — not a penny stock or micro-cap that moves on air

BreakoutAnalysis screens for exactly these characteristics, every 15 minutes during market hours.

## 🔧 What Does "Detect Breakout" Mean Here?

BreakoutAnalysis identifies breakout candidates using **configurable filters** applied in two stages:

### Stage 1 — Screener Filters *(applied in real-time via TradingView)*

These are the basic criteria a stock must pass to even be considered:

| Filter | Default | What it means |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Min % Change** | +6% | Stock is up at least 6% today |
| **Min Volume** | 1,000,000 | At least 1 million shares traded |
| **Min Relative Volume** | 2× | Trading 2× more than its 10-day average |
| **Price Range** | $0.50 – $100 | Avoids penny stocks and extremely high-priced shares |
| **Market Cap (non-tech)** | $200M+ | Filters out most micro-cap noise |

For **large-cap stocks (>$10B market cap)**, the min change is 6%.
For **smaller stocks**, the bar is set higher at 10% — because a small stock needs a stronger move to signal a real breakout.

### Stage 2 — Historical Quality Filter *(powered by Alpaca)*

After stage 1, the system checks each stock's **1-year and 5-year price history**. Stocks with weak long-term performance are filtered out — this helps avoid "junk" movers that spike and crash repeatedly.

> **You can adjust all of these filters** in `config/config.json` under `screeners.filters`.
> No coding needed — just change the numbers and restart the bot.

## 🛠️ The Tools Behind It

### TradingView
[TradingView](https://tradingview.com) is the world's most popular stock charting and screening platform, used by millions of traders. BreakoutAnalysis uses TradingView's screener API to scan the entire US market in seconds — the same data professional traders use.

- **Market Screener** — scans during regular market hours (9:30 AM – 4:00 PM ET)
- **Pre-Market Screener** — scans before the bell (4:00 AM – 9:30 AM ET) to catch early gappers
- Optional: TradingView account for **chart screenshots** sent with each alert (see Setup)

### Alpaca
[Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) is a commission-free brokerage and market data provider with a free developer API. BreakoutAnalysis uses Alpaca for two things:

1. **Historical stock data** — to filter out weak performers and confirm a stock has real strength over time
2. **Current quote data** — to verify live prices before sending an alert

Alpaca has a **free tier** (IEX feed — works great for screening) and a **premium tier** (SIP feed — consolidated data from all US exchanges, recommended for best accuracy).

| Alpaca Plan | Cost | Data Coverage |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | IEX exchange only — good for getting started |
| Algo Trader | ~$9/mo | **SIP — all US exchanges** ⭐ Recommended |

### AI Analysis (Gemini / GPT)
Each breakout candidate gets analyzed by an AI model that reads real-time news and writes a concise explanation of *why* the stock is moving, what levels to watch, and key risks. Supports:
- **Google Gemini** (free tier available at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com))
- **OpenAI GPT-4** (paid, at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com))
- **Local models** via Ollama (Llama 3.2 Vision, DeepSeek-R1 — runs on your own machine, no API key)

### Discord
Each breakout triggers a rich Discord notification with the ticker, price, % change, volume, sector, AI analysis, news headlines, and a TradingView chart image. One channel for individual stock alerts, another for the daily market briefing.
