    Monkey-patch upstream ``calculate_commission`` with the corrected fee curve.

    Upstream uses ``qty * price * fee_rate_bps_as_fraction`` (linear).
    The correct Polymarket formula is ``qty * feeRate * p * (1 - p)`` (curved),
    which peaks at p=0.50 and tapers toward the extremes.

    This is the only startup hook required. Call once at process start.
